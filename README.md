# wpdocker-wordmove

This is a companion to https://github.com/10up/wp-local-docker

Include this override file to your WP Docker project to integrate Wordmove.  Just make sure Wordmove file is named “Wordmove” (wordmove.yml should be renamed to Movefile) or config file edits will require restarting service.
